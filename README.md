    The concept for my Code Quiz came from a YouTube tutorial for a "Build a Quiz App" by James Q Quick.(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx)

    I am using this tutorial to help me understand the conctpt and layout of multiple screen switching using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To learn how to use tools and extensions like Live Server, Emmet and Rem in HTML and CSS.

    My Code Quiz presents you with a start screen and a start button. When clicked you are prompted to answer 5 code questions and when finished you are taken to a final screen where you can see your final score and enter you initials.

    Additional Features Include:
    1. A High scores button to click with top 5 high scores on the start screen.
    2. A progress bar that shows how many questions have been answered. 
    3. A dynamic layout that includes button styling with hover and glow effects.
    4. Is responsive to any screen or device. 
    5. can keep user data logged for references and high scores.
