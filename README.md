# Code-Quiz

The concept for my Code Quiz came from a YouTube tutorial for a "Build a Quiz App" by James Q Quick.

    I am using this tutorial to help me understand the conctpt and layout of multiple screen switching using JavaScript. To learn how to use tools and extensions like Live Server, Emmet and Rem in HTML and CSS.
